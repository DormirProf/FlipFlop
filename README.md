# FlipFlop
Well, hello about the lost traveler in GitHab, welcome to my repository.  
This is my first Android game on the Unity Engine (2020.3.11).  
I did it as best I could, gradually learning new features.  
For myself and for the people who will open this project, I want to add a plate, which shows what the scripts should be attached to on the stage. 
   
Plugins:  
-OdinInpector  
-GooglePlayGames  
-GoogleMobileAds  
-UniTask  
-Burst  
-TextMesh Pro  
  
Because there is a possibility that when the version is changed, the scripts will fly off, then it will be easier to navigate what and where is.  
Good Bye;
