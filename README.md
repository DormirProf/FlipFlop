# FlipFlop
Well, hello about the lost traveler in GitHab, welcome to my repository.  
This is my first Android game on the Unity Engine (2020.3.0).  
I did it as best I could, gradually learning new features.  
For myself and for the people who will open this project, I want to add a plate, which shows what the scripts should be attached to on the stage.  
Scripts:  
-Main Camera - GameIsOpen, LoadSelectBird, Pay, PurchaseManager.   
-Buttons - ScrollO.  
-MuteMusic - MuteMusic.
-PlayText,GameName,Record - SetActivation.  
-Shop - Add a Shop object to the button and select OpenAndCloseShop in the MainShop script and check the box.  
-LeaderBoard - Add a DetectClicks object to the button and select OpenLeader in the Detect script.  
-PlayText - MovingText.  
-BgRecover[1-2] - MoveBg.  
-Game - GameController.  
-DetectClicks - Detect.  
-Spawner - Spawner.  
-Bird [1-4] - MainBird.  
-BaseEnemy - EnemyBird.  
-Shop - MainShop, CloseShop.  
-SelectBirds - Add a Shop object to the button and select SelectMeny in the MainShop script and check the box.  
-SelectCoins - Add a Shop object to the button and select OpenAndCloseShop in the MainShop script and uncheck the box.  
-payCoins [1-3] - Add a Shop object to the button and select BuyConsumable in the PurchaseManager script.  
-payBird [1-4] - Add Shop object to the button and select PayBird in the MainShop script.  
Plugins:  
-OdinInpector  
-GooglePlayGames  
-GoogleMobileAds  
-UniTask  
-Burst  
-TextMesh Pro  
Because there is a possibility that when the version is changed, the scripts will fly off, then it will be easier to navigate what and where is.  
Good Bye;
